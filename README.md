# Features:
The app contains visually-appealing graphics and statistics obtained from the most accurate and updated API sources in the world such as the Johns Hopkins University's data.

The app features continuously updated global and country-wide data, shown in a total and daily basis in order to make relevant and trustworthy information incredibly easy to access through this app.

# Other Information:
Rejected from the App Store because I was an individual developer, rather than an accredited Healthcare/Educational institution. However, I still wanted to let people on both IOS and Android platforms try and download this app.
