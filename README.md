# Covid19 - Statistics
---

The app is built with the Flutter SDK. Refer to the Flutter Docs for installation and setup. The app was rejected from both the Appstore and Google Play since I'm an individual developer, but I still wanted to share this service with others to make it easy to access and find trustworthy information through a mobile app.

Currently, the app features:
 - Global: Total cases, deaths, recovered
 - Country List sorted alphabetically
    - Each Country: total cases, deaths, recovered, active cases, critical conditions, per day cases and deaths
 - Instructions as prescribed by the US's CDC for people to stay safe.
 - Developer About Page that can be used for future apps
 
 Possible future features:
  - State: case numbers similar to the country information
  - Maps: to observe the concentrations of cases within certain parts of the world
  - Search option for the countries and states, instead of scrolling through the current list
  - Others!
  
The API used is the Novel Covid API which uses data from Worldometer and the Johns Hopkins University to keep the data accurate. Refer to their github repository for API updates which could change how the app functions: [Novel Covid API](https://github.com/novelcovid/api).

Feel free to use this code, but just give me credit by mentioning my name or linking back to this github repository.
