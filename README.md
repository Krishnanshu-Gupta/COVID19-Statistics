We will assume you have set up your Github account and have a main page that looks like mine. You can add your favorite mug shot, some profile propaganda, etc. You can have up to 6 repositories pinned to the main page. In the upper right corner is the `+` button. Use that button to add a new repository to hold your meeting presentation content.
